# How this app is structured

It is a webpack project, so there are two folders: "dist" and "src".

## "src"-folder:  

- index.js:       Import and execute all necessary functions from the other js-files to run the app. 
- view.js:        Put here all functions and objects which renders HTML elements.
- model.js:       Put here all functions and objects which have to do with data.
- controller.js:  Put here all functions and objects which handle user inputs.

## "dist"-folder: 

- index.html:     Write basic HTML structure, a lot HTML is generated dynamically by JS
- main.js:        Minified js-file, used by index.html, generated by webpack using src/index.js as import
- main.js.map:    Maps minfied JS code of main.js to original JS code, very helpful for debugging
- reset.css:      Put here CSS to reset all CSS rules to avoid unexpected styling
- styl.css:       Put here CSS to style the elements of the app

## "root"-folder: 

- package.json:   Put dependencies here so that npm takes care of these
- package-lock.json: Guarantees that all installs have the same dependencies versions
- webpack.config.js: Configure behaviour of webpack
- .gitignore:     Put here all files you don't want to synch to github.
