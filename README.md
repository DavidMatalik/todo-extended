# Firebase 

- Use `npm run build` to build the project with webpack and deploy it to firebase hosting 
- [You will find the hosted site under:](https://todo-extended.web.app)
- Sometimes it's necessary to connect the local project with firebase, use `firebase login` or `firebase login --reauth` for this

# Tipps for better programming experience

- Use `npx webpack --watch` - This updates main.js as soon as there is a change
- Use live server - Then your app is updated in the browser as soon as there is a change
